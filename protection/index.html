            the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that, in
            addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection
            regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or
            domicile. If more specific legal bases are relevant in individual
            cases, we will inform you of them in the data protection
            declaration.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Consent (Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a. GDPR) - The person concerned
              has given their consent to the processing of their personal data
              for a specific purpose or several specific purposes
            </li>

          <h2>Safety Measures</h2>
          <p>
            We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in
            accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the
            state of the art, the implementation costs and the type, scope,
            circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the
            different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat
            to the rights and freedoms of natural persons to ensure a level of
            protection appropriate to the risk. The measures include, in
            particular, securing the confidentiality, integrity and availability
            of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as
            well as access, input, disclosure, securing availability and their
            separation. Furthermore, we have set up procedures that ensure the
            exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data and reactions
            to data threats. Furthermore, we already take the protection of
            personal data into account during the development or selection of
            hardware, software and processes in accordance with the principle of
            data protection, through technology design and through data
            protection-friendly default settings.

          <h2>Transmission of Personal Data</h2>
          <p>
            As part of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the
            data is transmitted to other bodies, companies, legally independent
            organizational units or persons or that it is disclosed to them. The
            recipients of this data can include, for example, service providers
            commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that
            are integrated into a website. In such a case, we observe the legal
            requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or
            agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to protect
            your data.

          <h2>Data Processing in Third Countries</h2>
          <p>
            If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European
            Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing
            within the framework of the use of third-party services or the
            disclosure or transmission of data to other persons, bodies or
            companies takes place, this is only done in accordance with the

          <h2>Deletion of Data</h2>
          <p>
            The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the
            legal requirements as soon as your consent to processing is revoked
            or other permissions are no longer applicable (e.g. if the purpose
            of processing this data no longer applies or it is not required for
            the purpose). If the data is not deleted because it is required for
            other, legally permissible purposes, its processing will be limited
            to these purposes. This means that the data will be blocked and not
            processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data
            that must be stored for commercial or tax reasons or whose storage
            is necessary to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or to
            protect the rights of another natural or legal person. Our data
            protection information can also contain further information on the
            storage and deletion of data, which apply primarily to the
            respective processing.

          <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are text files containing data from websites or domains
            visited and are stored by a browser on the user's computer. A cookie
            is primarily used to store information about a user during or after
            their visit to an online offer. The stored information can include,
            for example, the language settings on a website, the login status, a
            shopping cart or the place where a video was viewed. The term
            cookies also includes other technologies that fulfill the same
            functions as cookies (e.g. when user information is stored using
            pseudonymous online identifiers, also known as "user IDs"). The
            following cookie types and functions are distinguished:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Temporary cookies (also: session or session cookies): Temporary
              cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online
              offer and closed his browser
            </li>
            <li>
              Permanent cookies: Permanent cookies remain stored even after the
              browser is closed. For example, the login status can be saved or
              preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a
              website again. Likewise, the interests of users, which are used to
              measure reach or for marketing purposes, can be stored in such a
              cookie
            </li>
            <li>First-party cookies: First-party cookies are set by us</li>
            <li>
              Third-party cookies (also: third-party cookies) : Third-party
              cookies are mainly used by advertisers (so-called third parties)
              to process user information
            </li>
            <li>
              Necessary (also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies:
              Cookies can be absolutely necessary for the operation of a website
              (e.g. to save logins or other user entries or for security
              reasons)
            </li>
            <li>
              Statistics, marketing and personalization cookies : Cookies are
              also usually used to measure range and when the interests of a
              user or his behavior (e.g. viewing certain content, using
              functions, etc.) on individual websites in a user profile get
              saved. Such profiles are used to show users, for example, content
              that corresponds to their potential interests. This procedure is
              also referred to as "tracking", ie tracking the potential
              interests of users. If we use cookies or "tracking" technologies,
              we will inform you separately in our data protection declaration
              or when obtaining consent
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Notes on legal bases: The legal basis on which we process your
            personal data with the help of cookies depends on whether we ask for
            your consent. If this is the case and you consent to the use of
            cookies, the legal basis for the processing of your data is the
            declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of
            cookies will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests
            (e.g. in the commercial operation of our online offer and its
            improvement) or if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our
            contractual obligations. Storage period: If we do not provide you
            with any explicit information on the storage period of permanent
            cookies (e.g. as part of a so-called cookie opt-in), please assume
            that the storage period can be up to two years. General information
            on revocation and objection (opt-out): Depending on whether the
            processing is based on consent or legal permission, you have the
            option at any time to revoke your consent or to object to the
            processing of your data by cookie technologies ( collectively
            referred to as "opt-out"). You can initially declare your objection
            using the settings in your browser, e.g. by deactivating the use of
            cookies (which can also limit the functionality of our online
            offer). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing

          <h2>Provions of the Online Offer and Web Hosting</h2>
          <p>
            In order to be able to provide our online offer securely and
            efficiently, we use the services of one or more web hosting
            providers from whose servers (or servers managed by them) the online
            offer can be accessed. For these purposes, we may use infrastructure
            and platform services, computing capacity, storage space and
            database services, as well as security and technical maintenance
            services. The data processed as part of the provision of the hosting
            offer may include all information relating to the users of our
            online offer that arises in the course of use and communication.
            This regularly includes the IP address, which is necessary in order
            to be able to deliver the content of online offers to browsers, and
            all entries made within our online offer or on websites. Collection
            of access data and log files : We ourselves (or our web hosting
            provider) collect data for each access to the server (so-called
            server log files). The address and name of the retrieved websites
            and files, date and time of retrieval, amounts of data transferred,
            notification of successful retrieval, browser type and version, the
            user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page)
            and, as a rule, IP Addresses and the requesting provider belong. The
            server log files can be used on the one hand for security purposes,
            e.g. to avoid overloading the server (especially in the case of
            abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and on the other hand to
            ensure server utilization and stability.

          <h2>Web Analysis, Monitoring, and Optimization</h2>
          <p>
            The web analysis (also referred to as "reach measurement") serves to
            evaluate the flow of visitors to our online offer and can include
            behavior, interests or demographic information about the visitors,
            such as age or gender, as pseudonymous values. With the help of the
            range analysis, we can, for example, identify the time at which our
            online offer or its functions or content are used most frequently or
            invite users to reuse them. We can also understand which areas need
            optimization. In addition to web analysis, we can also use test
            procedures, for example to test and optimize different versions of
            our online offering or its components. For these purposes, so-called
            user profiles can be created and stored in a file (so-called
            "cookie") or similar processes can be used for the same purpose.
            This information can include, for example, content viewed, websites
            visited and elements used there and technical information such as
            the browser used, the computer system used and information on usage
            times. If users have consented to the collection of their location
            data, this can also be processed depending on the provider. The IP
            addresses of the users are also saved. However, we use an IP masking
            process (ie pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to
            protect users. In general, no clear user data (e.g. e-mail addresses
            or names) are stored in the context of web analysis, A/B testing and
            optimization, but pseudonyms. This means that we and the providers
            of the software used do not know the actual identity of the users,
            but only the information stored in their profiles for the purposes
            of the respective process. Notes on legal bases: If we ask users for
            their consent to the use of third-party providers, the legal basis
            for processing data is consent. Otherwise, user data is processed on
            the basis of our legitimate interests (ie interest in efficient,
            economical and recipient-friendly services). In this context, we
            would also like to draw your attention to the information on the use
            of cookies in this data protection declaration.

          <h2>Online Marketing</h2>
          <p>
            We process personal data for online marketing purposes, which may
            include in particular the marketing of advertising space or the
            presentation of advertising and other content (collectively referred
            to as "content") based on the potential interests of users and the
            measurement of their effectiveness. For these purposes, so-called
            user profiles are created and stored in a file (so-called "cookie")
            or similar processes are used, by means of which the information
            about the user relevant to the presentation of the aforementioned
            content is stored. This information can include, for example,
            content viewed, websites visited, online networks used, but also
            communication partners and technical information such as the browser
            used, the computer system used and information on usage times. If
            users have consented to the collection of their location data, this
            can also be processed. The IP addresses of the users are also saved.
            However, we use available IP masking procedures (ie pseudonymization
            by shortening the IP address) to protect users. In general, no clear
            user data (such as e-mail addresses or names) are stored as part of
            the online marketing process, but pseudonyms. This means that we and
            the providers of the online marketing process do not know the actual
            identity of the users, only the information stored in their
            profiles. The information in the profiles is usually stored in the
            cookies or by means of similar processes. These cookies can later
            generally also be read on other websites that use the same online
            marketing process and analyzed for the purpose of displaying
            content, as well as supplemented with further data and stored on the
            server of the online marketing process provider. As an exception,
            clear data can be assigned to the profiles. This is the case, for
            example, if the users are members of a social network whose online
            marketing process we use and the network connects the user's profile
            with the aforementioned information. We kindly ask you to note that
            users can make additional agreements with the providers, e.g. by
            giving their consent during registration. In principle, we only
            receive access to summarized information about the success of our
            advertisements. However, we can use so-called conversion
            measurements to check which of our online marketing processes have
            led to a so-called conversion, ie, to a contract with us, for
            example. The conversion measurement is only used to analyze the
            success of our marketing measures. Unless otherwise stated, please
            assume that cookies used will be stored for a period of two years.
            Notes on legal bases: If we ask users for their consent to the use
            of third-party providers, the legal basis for processing data is
            consent. Otherwise, user data is processed on the basis of our
            legitimate interests (ie interest in efficient, economical and
            recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to
            draw your attention to the information on the use of cookies in this
            data protection declaration. We use the "Google Marketing Platform"
            (and services such as "Google Ad Manager") to place ads on the
            Google advertising network (e.g., in search results, in videos, on
            websites, etc.). The Google Marketing Platform is characterized by
            the fact that ads are displayed in real time based on users'
            presumed interests. This allows us to display ads for and within our
            online offering in a more targeted manner in order to only present
            users with ads that potentially match their interests. If, for
            example, a user is shown ads for products that he was interested in
            on other online offers, this is referred to as "remarketing".

              Google Tag Manager: Google Tag Manager is a solution with which we
              can manage so-called website tags via an interface and thus
              integrate other services into our online offer (further
              information is referred to in this data protection declaration).
              With the Tag Manager itself (which implements the tags), e.g. For
              example, no user profiles have been created or cookies have been
              saved. Google only learns the IP address of the user, which is
              necessary to run the Google Tag Manager. Service provider: Google

          <h2>Presence in Social Networks</h2>
          <p>
            We maintain online presences within social networks and process user
            data in this context in order to communicate with the users active
            there or to offer information about us. We would like to point out
            that user data can be processed outside of the European Union. This
            can result in risks for the user because, for example, the
            enforcement of the user's rights could be made more difficult.
            Furthermore, user data is usually processed within social networks
            for market research and advertising purposes. For example, usage
            profiles can be created on the basis of usage behavior and the
            resulting interests of users. The usage profiles can in turn be
            used, for example, to place advertisements inside and outside the
            networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the user.
            For these purposes, cookies are usually stored on the users'
            computers, in which the usage behavior and the interests of the
            users are stored. Furthermore, data can also be stored in the usage
            profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially
            if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged
            in to them). For a detailed description of the respective forms of
            processing and the possibility of objection (opt-out), we refer to
            the data protection declarations and information provided by the
            operators of the respective networks. Also in the case of requests
            for information and the assertion of data subject rights, we would
            like to point out that these can be asserted most effectively with
            the providers. Only the providers have access to the data of the
            users and can take appropriate measures and provide information
            directly. If you still need help, you can contact us.

          <h2>Plugins and Embedded Functions/Content</h2>
          <p>
            We integrate functional and content elements into our online offer
            that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers
            (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These can be,
            for example, graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter referred to
            as "content" ). The integration always requires that the third-party
            providers of this content process the IP address of the user, since
            without the IP address they could not send the content to their
            browser. The IP address is therefore required for the display of
            this content or functions. We endeavor to only use content whose
            respective providers only use the IP address to deliver the content.
            Third-party providers can also use so-called pixel tags (invisible
            graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing
            purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such
            as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. Notes on legal
            bases: If we ask users for their consent to the use of third-party
            providers, the legal basis for processing data is consent.
            Otherwise, user data is processed on the basis of our legitimate
            interests (ie interest in efficient, economical and
            recipient-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to
            draw your attention to the information on the use of cookies in this
            data protection declaration. Instagram Plugins and Content: We are
            in partnership with Facebook Ireland Ltd. for the collection or
            receipt as part of a transmission (but not further processing) of
            "event data" that Facebook collects using Instagram functions (e.g.
            embedding functions for content) that are carried out on our online
            offer or in the within the scope of a transmission for the following
            purposes, jointly responsible: a) display of content and advertising
            information that correspond to the presumed interests of the user;
            b) Delivery of commercial and transaction-related messages (e.g.
            addressing users via Facebook Messenger); c) Improving the delivery
            of ads and personalizing functions and content (e.g. improving the
            recognition of which content or advertising information presumably
            corresponds to the interests of users).

            affected (ie users can, for example, send information or requests
            for deletion directly to Facebook). Note: If Facebook provides us
            with measurements, analyzes and reports (which are aggregated, i.e.
            do not contain any information on individual users and are anonymous

          <h2>Definition of Terms</h2>
          <p>
            This section provides you with an overview of the terms used in this
            data protection declaration. Many of the terms are taken from the
            law and defined above all in Art. 4 GDPR. The legal definitions are
            binding. The following explanations, on the other hand, are intended
            primarily for understanding. The terms are sorted alphabetically.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              IP masking: "IP masking" is a method in which the last octet, ie
              the last two digits of an IP address, is deleted so that the IP
              address can no longer be used to uniquely identify a person.
              Therefore, IP masking is a means of pseudonymizing processing
              methods, especially in online marketing
            </li>
            <li>
              Personal data: "Personal data" means any information relating to
              an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter "data
              subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be
              identified directly or indirectly, in particular by means of
              assignment to an identifier such as a name, an identification
              number, location data, an online identifier (e.g. cookie) or one
              or more special features, are an expression of the physical,
              physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
              identity of that natural person
            </li>
            <li>
              Profiles with user-related information: The processing of
              "profiles with user-related information", or "profiles" for short,
              includes any type of automated processing of personal data that
              consists of using this personal data to identify certain personal
              aspects relating to a natural person (depending on the type of
              profiling, different information regarding demographics, behavior
              and interests, such as interaction with websites and their
              content, etc.) can be analyzed, evaluated or predicted (e.g.
              interests in certain content or products, click behavior on a
              website or location). Cookies and web beacons are often used for
              profiling purposes
            </li>
            <li>
              Range measurement: The range measurement (also referred to as web
              analytics) is used to evaluate the flow of visitors to an online
              offer and can include the behavior or interests of visitors in
              certain information, such as website content. With the help of the
              range analysis, website owners can, for example, see at what time
              visitors visit their website and what content they are interested
              in. This enables them, for example, to better adapt the content of
              the website to the needs of their visitors. Pseudonymous cookies
              and web beacons are often used for range analysis purposes in
              order to recognize returning visitors and thus obtain more precise
              analyzes of the use of an online offer
            </li>
            <li>
              Responsible: The "responsible person" is the natural or legal
              person, authority, institution or other body that alone or jointly
              with others decides on the purposes and means of processing
              personal data
            </li>
            <li>
              Processing: "Processing" is any process or series of processes
              carried out with or without the aid of automated processes in
              connection with personal data. The term goes far and covers
              practically every handling of data, be it collection, evaluation,
              storage, transmission or deletion
            </li>

        Ree6 has been made to support users and give them enough tools to
        support and manage their Guild. We don't like how most of the Discord
        Bots want you to pay for special "features". So we decided to change
        that.
