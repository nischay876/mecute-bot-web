          <h2>Children's Information</h2>
          <p>
            Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while
            using the internet. We encourage parents and guardians to observe,
            participate in, and/or monitor and guide their online activity. Ree6

            provided this kind of information on our website, we strongly
            encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best
            efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.

        Ree6 has been made to support users and give them enough tools to
        support and manage their Guild. We don't like how most of the Discord
        Bots want you to pay for special "features". So we decided to change
        that.
